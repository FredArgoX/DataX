<p class="code-concept">Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.</p>
<p class="code-concept"><span class="blue">The method used for regression is called Support Vector Regression (SVR).</span></p>
<p class="code-concept">As with classification, the fit method will take as argument vectors X, y, only that in this case <span class="blue">y is expected to have floating point values</span> instead of integer values.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Instead of maximizing the margin between classes, as performed in SVC, SVR tries to fit as many data points as possible within a given margin (<span class="blue">ε-insensitive-tube</span>) It is called -insensitive- because  predictions within this margin (±ε) are not penalized in the loss function, in other words, the model is insensitive to data points that are within the ε-range. Therefore, SVR is only sensitive to outliers because it only considers data points outside the ε margin as support vectors.</p>
<p class="code-concept"><span class="blue">SVR supports linear and non-linear regression</span> using different kernel functions.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Like SVM for classification, <span class="blue">feature scaling is crucial for SVR</span> because the algorithm is sensitive to distances between data points. Scaling ensures that no feature dominates the optimization process.</p>
