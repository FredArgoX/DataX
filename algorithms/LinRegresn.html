<p class="code-concept">Linear Regression is a parametric supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.</p>
<p class="code-concept">The most common way to do linear regression is through ordinary least squares (<span class="blue">OLS</span>) estimation. </p>
<p class="code-concept">OLS works by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values (the actual data points) and the predicted values from the regression line. These differences are called <span class="blue">residuals</span>, and squaring them ensures that both positive and negative residuals are treated equally. </p>
<p class="code-concept">The Linear Regression model assumes <span class="blue">linearity</span> between the independent and dependent variables, <span class="blue">independence of errors</span> (no patterns or correlation between the residuals), <span class="blue">homoscedasticity</span> (constant variance of residuals), and <span class="blue">normality of residuals</span> (residuals should ideally follow a normal or gaussian distribution).</p>
<!--<p class="code-concept">Autocorrelation, Multicollinearity?</p>-->
<p class="code-concept">Performing linear regression with categorical features requires some preprocessing since linear regression works with numerical data. <span class="blue">Categorical features need to be converted into a numerical format</span> that the model can interpret.</p>
<p class="code-concept">For OLS linear regression without regularization, <span class="blue">there is no technical requirement for feature scaling</span>, as the coefficients will adjust to the scale of the features.</p>
