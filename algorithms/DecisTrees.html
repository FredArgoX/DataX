<p class="code-concept">A <span class="blue">Decision Tree (DT)</span> is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks.</p>
<p class="code-concept">It is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Can be considered a <span class="blue">white box algorithm</span>. It shares internal decision-making logic, which is not available in the black box type of algorithms such as with a neural network.</p>
<p class="code-concept"><span class="blue">DecisionTreeClassifier</span> is a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Decision Trees <span class="blue">can handle categorical features, but they need to be properly encoded</span>. Some approaches include Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding.</p>
<p class="code-concept">When dealing with very high-dimensional datasets, it's <span class="blue">important to consider performing dimensionality reduction</span> (PCA, ICA) <span class="blue">or Feature Selection</span> beforehand to give the tree a better chance of finding features that are discriminative.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Decision Trees partition the feature space by selecting threshold values (e.g., Age < 30) rather than computing distances. Therefore, <span class="blue">feature scaling is not required</span>.</p>
