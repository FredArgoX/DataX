<p class="code-concept">Logistic regression is a statistical method for <span class="blue">binary classification</span> that predicts the probability of an event using a logit function. It is estimated through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS), which is used in linear regression.</p>
<p class="code-concept">The sigmoid function maps values to a range between 0 and 1, making it useful for classification tasks.</p>
<p class="code-concept"><span class="blue">Feature scaling is not required for Logistic Regression</span> like it is for distance-based algorithms. However, while it does not strictly require feature scaling, scaling can still improve performance in certain cases.</p>
<p class="code-concept">While logistic regression is inherently a two-class classifier, techniques like one-vs-rest enable its use in multi-class problems. It can be categorized into binary logistic regression for two-class outcomes, multinomial logistic regression for multiple nominal categories, and ordinal logistic regression for ordered categories.</p>
