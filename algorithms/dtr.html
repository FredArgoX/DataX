<p class="code-concept">A <span class="blue">Decision Tree (DT)</span> is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks.</p>
<p class="code-concept">In Regression, the goal is to predict continuous values instead of discrete class labels. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into partitions based on feature values, where each internal node represents a decision rule, and leaf nodes represent predicted numerical outputs, commonly the mean (sometimes the median) value for each partitioned region.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Decision Trees are considered <span class="blue">white-box</span> models, meaning their decision-making process is transparent and interpretable, unlike black-box models such as neural networks.</p>
<p class="code-concept"><span class="blue">DecisionTreeRegressor</span> is a class capable of performing regression tasks using a decision tree model.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Decision Trees <span class="blue">can handle categorical features, but they need to be properly encoded</span>. Some approaches include Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding.</p>
<p class="code-concept">When dealing with very high-dimensional datasets, it's <span class="blue">important to consider performing dimensionality reduction</span> (PCA, ICA) <span class="blue">or Feature Selection</span> beforehand to give the tree a better chance of finding features that are discriminative.</p>
<p class="code-concept">Decision Trees partition the feature space by selecting threshold values (e.g., Age < 30) rather than computing distances. Therefore, <span class="blue">feature scaling is not required</span>.</p>
