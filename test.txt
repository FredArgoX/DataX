Assumptions:

Linearity: Relationship between features and target is linear.

Independence: Observations are independent of each other.

Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.

No multicollinearity: Features should not be highly correlated.

Normally distributed residuals.


Feature Scaling: Not required for standard Linear Regression, but beneficial when using regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso.
